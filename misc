Avoid putting restart commands in your scripts if you can. 
You want your policy to complete and the Mac to report completion to Jamf Pro before the restart. 
If you need to put a restart in your script, you can give it a slight delay and send it to a background process using something like:

shutdown -r +1 &

This restarts the computer in one minute. 
The ampersand sends this to another process to allow the script to complete.

You may event want to use jamfHelper's feature to display a full screen message to the user to prevent doing anything while Jamf Pro is installing the updates.
