To get around that, you can run a script instead that does the jamf reboot command but puts it into the background, 
meaning it won't wait for an OK button to be clicked before starting the countdown to reboot.

jamf reboot \
-minutes 10 \
-message "Your Mac will reboot in 10 minutes to maintain smooth working order. Please close any open work now to avoid data loss of unsaved documents." \
